# Break the Barrier Design Document 
### This document will go over the general ideas, goals, and planned progression for Break the barrier
This intends to allow me to plan out ideas better, and will better allow for feedback.

# Pack main themes 
* Speedrunnable/quick (100h max) Gregpack
* Pack is centered around building a giant laser to shatter a overhead barrier keeping the player trapped within a dimension
* Pack is mostly GTCE(u) content, with a few other mods to fill in content were needed
  * List will be found in the mods section
* Player optains resources from drills (work like omnifactory microminers)
  * Most resources to craft the next tier of (thing) can be optained with drills

# Speedrunnable/quick
* High pressure steam machines will be the default
* Player spawns with some resources 
  * Some metal parts, as well as some related crafttweaker stuff (remains of a broken jetpack)  
   * Enough to either build a coal or solar boiler (player can choose)
  * Saplings
  * Cobble gen
  * Water gen (gregicality?)
  * Bonemeal(?)
* The pack will have 4/5 voltage tiers. 
 * Machines tiers will end at HV/EV tier, and the laser will be the only machine to accept EV/IV power
 * This makes for 5/6 Tiers overall, when factoring in a (relatively short) steam age

# The dimension
* The player will be locked into spawning into a custom (premade) dimension
* The area will be a decently sized starting area, with a decently sized shaft of light in the middle
* [The starting area of undertale is a good visual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70342772/143727600-03b48a54-caf8-4857-927d-60212040e77b.png)
* The dimension itself is Infinite, allowing players to expand as needed
* Difficulty is locked to peaceful.

# Drills 
* Drills function somewhat like omnifactory's microminers
* Drills have their own Drill base per drill tier
* To launch a drill, players will need the drill itself, some other related item, energy (with the execption of the steam powered drill) and also a special fluid
  * The fluids required start out fairly simple, but ramp up in complexity rapidly
   * Example fluids could be nitro-diesel, heavy and light fuel, oil, and of course custom fluids
   * Some drill missions could disobey this format to give players alterative ways to optain some items
    * eg Creosole could be used to net the player a large amount of wood, rather than having to set up a wood farm

# Laser 
* TBD

# Progression
* Player spawns in 
* ???
* Laser is fired
