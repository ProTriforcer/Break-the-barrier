# Break the Barrier Design Document 
### This document will go over the general ideas, goals, and planned progression for Break the barrier
This intends to allow me to plan out ideas better, and will better allow for feedback. 

[Discord](https://discord.gg/N8b2JEfAqb) 

Of course, everything in this document is subject to change. 

# Pack main themes 
* Pack is centered around building a giant laser to shatter a overhead barrier keeping the player trapped within a dimension
* Pack is centered around GTCE(u) 
    * Only power is GTEU (with autoconversion into RF via GT cables)
* Player obtains resources from drills 
    * Most resources to craft the next tier of (thing) can be obtained with drills


# Spawning in

* Player spawns with some resources 
    * Some metal parts, as well as some related crafttweaker stuff (remains of a broken jetpack)  
    * Enough to either build a coal boiler
    * Saplings
    * CEu Water gen 
    * Bonemeal(?) 


# The dimension
* The player will be locked into spawning into a custom (premade) dimension
* The area will be a decently sized starting area, with a decently sized shaft of light in the middle
    * Allows players to take advantage of CEu's additional panel tiers.
    * [The starting area of undertale is a good visual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70342772/143727600-03b48a54-caf8-4857-927d-60212040e77b.png)
* The dimension itself is Infinite, allowing players to expand as needed
* Difficulty is locked to peaceful.
* The blocks that make up this dimension can be broken into cobblestone with a ex nilio hammer.
    * This will also be the players source of sand, gravel, and clay (via barrel) in premachine 


# Drills 
* Drills function somewhat like omnifactory's microminers
* Drills require Drill bases to launch.
* Drills will give smaller amounts of materials, but will be used faster, and use less power if the drill base is in constant use. Incourages constant creation of drills. 
    * Tier one drill base will be an exception to this rule, due to running on steam.
* To launch a drill, players will need the drill itself, some other related item, energy (with the execption of the steam powered drill) and also a special fluid
    * The fluids required start out fairly simple, but ramp up in complexity rapidly
        * Example fluids could be nitro-diesel, heavy and light fuel, oil, and of course custom fluids
    * Some drill missions could disobey this format to give players alterative ways to optain some items, or be the only method to obtain some (misc items)
        * A good example would be the overworld Drill 
            * Overworld Drill missions are split into different biomes, determined by circuit number
            * Each mission contains its relevant wood, saplings, tall grass (if relevant), Plants, and a flower color
            *Would also allow for more efficient methods to gain some mod resources via specialized drills (eg mana diamonds can be drilled up, rather than generated with a mana pool). Would require items from later in the mod.
* In Late/endgame, there will be versions of previous drills that are reusable (and do not require fluids) to help save on TPS, ala omnifactory STE stabilized microminers

# Drill base tiers 
* Tier one drill base
     * The tier one drill base is the only drill base that operates on steam, and does not require energy.
        * To balance this, the drills that belong to this drill base are is the only one to bring ingots, rather than ores, to prevent ore processing. Also, this drill base is exempt from the efficiency bonus.
            * This also has the helpful conquence of allowing players to skip waiting for ingots to smelt in the early game, as they would have little to no options for ore processing anyways.
    * The tier one drill base's drills focus mainly on steam machinary related metals, and the push into LV.  
* Tier two drill base
    * Runs on LV power 
    * Focuses on creating more LV machines, and pushing into MV
    * Also has some recipes that allow the player to expand their resource options. 

# Drill tiers 
* Tier one drill
    * Belongs to the Tier one drill base
    * Crafted with wood and stone related materials
    * Brings copper, tin, and iron ingots as well as redstone
* Tier two drill
    * Belongs to the tier one drill base
    * Crafted with materials related to high pressure steam machinary 
    * Brings larger amounts of copper and tin ingots, as well as obsidian and coal.
* Tier three drill
    * Belongs to the tier two drill base
    * Crafted with LV machine parts
    * First drill to require an actual fluid to launch, luberant.
        * Is a fairly simple one to start off.
    * Brings back more metals (now ores) related to LV machinary

* Tier four drill
    * Belongs to the tier two drill base
    * Crafted with LV machine parts
    * Fluid requirement is drill fluid
    * Brings back ores related to MV, as well as nickel 
* This allows for crafting cupronickel, and thus the first EBF and multismelter tiers.

# Mods
### massive TBD

# DNA 
* Animals are created by DNA fuckery (or something like that) in multiblock(s). Most of the animals would be cosmetic, with some being faster methods of getting some items.
* Of course, DNA itself would be used for wetwares.

# Mod specific stuff 
## Actually Additions 
* Item lasers are a godsend for automating asslines
* The reconstructor can be crafttweaked 
* Multiblock for (easier) Atomic reconstructor automation. Frankly the standard method works well enough for me, but some may want a MB for it.

## Volumetric flasks
* With the major role fluids would be having, volumetric flasks would be worth having 
* Have a dedicated multiblock for crafting Volumetric flasks (can dedicate each hatch to a different size of flask via circuit)
    * Would use molten glass

## Botania 
* Botania is going to be the first mod that the player will use to progress in GT 
* As well as being required in some recipes, botania will also unlock some alterative/more efficient methods of gathering some items
* Botaniatweaker, Botanic Additions, and Botania Tweaks will be used for extending and modifying botania.
    * Also adds a double capacity mana pool
* Botania runes/flowers can be crafted in a extended crafting table (or a multiblock) rather than the alter thing
    * Allows for easier automation
* Modified recipes to account for the lack of petals 
* Make CEu devs allow for botania mana compat so it can be used in MBT multis. If not, use Modmach.

## Ex nilio 
* More or less everything outside of sieves are enabled
 
# Laser 
* The laser is to be the only MAX tier machine in the pack, and is to have a decently sized startup EU cost 
* The laser  firing off will give the player EE2 stuff, rather than creative vending like every pack ever.

# Storage options 
* For players that absolutely need their connected storage ASAP, a somewhat gutted version of SSN will be available as early as steam
    *  Only contains the default cable, normal and crafting interface, all I/O is disabled
    * Will be retextured to fit the pack 
    * Would be fairly cheap
* PAE2, trouser's fork of AE2, will be the main storage option for the pack
    *  Will probably be unlocked in MV

# Random bits and Misc
### Most of the stuff in this section are random bits that while still impacting gameplay, couldn't come up with a dedicated section for it (yet)
* Clay can be made in a chemical reactor via dust and water
* No BBF
* Steel could  be created in a alloy smelter, but would be less efficient than a EBF
* "Void world" would be achieved via telling the player to use a rftools builder :trollface:
* No thaumcraft
* Grass can be made via bonemeal and dirt in a chemical reactor, among other methods (botania?)
* EBF coils instead of a trillion small coils in late game circuits
    * Why not
 
# Misc Ideas
* Botania power gen options?
* Have that one gasoline botania flower from FTBI be introduced midgame 
* Heart of the smogus as a secret item. Does nothing.
    * Or causes the player to die instantly upon consumption 
* Some custom music discs, community voted?
* QMD (and NC) may have a role in progression?


# Progression 
### Progression noted here will be somewhat barebones, with a quest book going into more detail.

* Player spawns in, with the items noted above
* Plant saplings, mine worldgen blocks to make cobble, clay, etc
* Player makes a coal powered boiler
* Create tier one drill base, made with bricks and BBF bricks (brick dust can be made by mining brick blocks with a ex nilio hammer)
* Craft Tier one drill
* Build up steam infastucture
* Create tier two drill
* Craft Basic ciruits (chad can be obtained by pulverising wood dust)
* Create LV machines 
* Create tier two drill base
* Passive lube with seed oil (progressive automation will be helpful)
* Create tier three drill 
* Build up LV infastucture 
* Create tier four drill
* Build first EBF and Multismelter (woo easier steel)
* Craft first MV circuits
* Start botania 





* ???
* Laser is fired
