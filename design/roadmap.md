# Break The Barrier roadmap
### Tentive, as things will no doubt change as elements are added and removed, but should be a basic idea.


### 0.2.1
- Determine the fate of botania
- Add some misc QOL improvements
- Menu overhaul (again)

### 0.3 
- HV tier
- Introduce oil
- Introduce PackageEX
- Bring out the most complex chains in base ceu for the drill fluids 

### 0.4
- EV tier
- Introduce GCY:S. (It will be used mostly for its fluid chains [Machines will stick to base ceu tiers])
- Introduce the basics of QMD 

### 0.5
- IV-LUV
- Get into QMD
- Introduce DNA (will be used both for wetwares and for spawning animals) 
- Monitor 

### 0.6
- ZPM-UV
- Late/endgame of QMD
- Genetic modification?Â  
- Will probably need to ask zalgo for interesting ideas. 
- Most of the challenge in this section will simply be having everything running constantly, as resource costs will be extremely high as you make your way towards laser. 

### 0.7
- Endgame
- Introduces the laser, which requires blocks from every tier, and requires a comedically large fluid chain and a fuckton of power to fire.
- Add EE2 items as a reward for firing the laser (disable emc tooltips) 

### 1.0 
- Clean up anything missing
- Have a dedicated custom map made (if not done already)
- Allow to the player to go into the "overworld"
- Coremod so that the laser firing could have some sfx?
